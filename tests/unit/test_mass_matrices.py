"""Unit tests for the mass matrices of the implicit solvers.

The mass matrices ``S`` are the linear response of the deposited current
density to the electric field, ``dJ = S dE``, which the implicit solvers use
in place of pushing and depositing the particles at every linear iteration.
They are deposited in ``Source/Particles/Deposition/MassMatricesDeposition.H``
and applied in ``ImplicitSolver::ApplyMassMatrices``. The tests below check
them against the result of pushing the particles and depositing the current.
